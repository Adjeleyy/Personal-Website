                <p>One day, I woke up to the jarring sound of my alarm clock which indicated the dread of facing
                    another
                    day in a career that would soon become history.
                    A career that no longer aligned with my goals, dreams and passions.</p>

                <p>That was the day I decided to fully pursue frontend engineering, after several days of
                    overthinking,
                    about everything that could possibly go wrong and of course, talking
                    to a couple of trusted people who are very dear to me.</p>

                <p>Now, this is the happiest I have been in my career and I can't help but keep wishing I took this bold step earlier. I am looking
                    forward to
                    changing lives with my new career, and I hope to also inspire others to take the risk and
                    pursue
                    their heart desires.</p>
